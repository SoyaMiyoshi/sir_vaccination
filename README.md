-1 Take the average of each input network after convergence, then average them over for different nwk sizes  
-2 plot them for different param(ex proprotion of conformist etc) and for different nwk sizes  

-bigger nwk size (extrapolate to infinity)
	-to see if thre is phase transition  
	-find func(outbreak size etc) that goes to 0 or infinity  
	-order parameter (function that indicates if there is phase transition) if one discriptive value goes to 0 at o  
	-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition
-generate more # of nwk to give to the C  (1000, 2000)  
-plot using line (not fitted, just draw lines in btwn points)  
-time to convergence  
-Think about how results should be averaged over  
-Memory  
  -Strategy proportion transition illustrated (x:time, y:utility, proportion of each strategy mapped)
