# About this branch  
Short-term memory was introduced for each agent.  
Each agent retains a short term memory of the payoffs in the five (length of this memory can be easily changed) past seasons. This short term memory determines how each agent interprets information from their neighbor. That is, each agent will choose to take either a conformist or rationalist approach that gave them the highest payoff.
