Take the average of each input network after convergence, then average them over for different nwk sizes.    
Plot them for different param(ex proprotion of conformist etc) and for different nwk sizes.  
Bigger nwk size (extrapolate to infinity) to see if there is phase transition find func(outbreak size etc)   
that goes to 0 or infinity order parameter (function that indicates if there is phase transition) if one descriptive value goes to 0 at o  
generate more # of nwk to give to the C (1000, 2000) plot using line (not fitted, just draw lines in btwn points) time to convergence  
Think about how results should be averaged over  

Memory Strategy proportion transition illustrated (x:time, y:utility, proportion of each strategy mapped)
